# Roc RFCs

RFC (Request for comments) are a structured way to discuss potential
changes to the Roc language, ecosystem, or implementation.

## Creating an RFC

The RFC process is in its infancy. Before creating an RFC, please create a
thread to discuss a topic of interest on [Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com/).
The Roc community is most active on Zulip, making it the best forum for
ideation.

RFCs added to this repository should motivate problems that require
substantial analysis to come up with an ideal solution. RFCs should explain a
problem clearly, provide alternatives, and propose a solution.

### Naming

RFCs are named `<number>-<descriptive-name>.md` in the `rfcs/` directory.

The RFC number `0000` is reserved.

RFCs numbered less than `0100` are reserved for backfilling existing decisions
to the Roc language.

A new RFC should use the next number larger than `0100` not already in use.
